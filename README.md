## Physics
### Power at the crank to forward force
Power at the crank is equal to propulsive force at the rear wheel times drivetrain losses. This can be reorganized to the equation for force

F_rider = P / v, where velocity is relative to the ground.

For now we will assume there are no drivetrain losses, so power at the crank is equal to power at the rear wheel. This means that force in the forward direction is equal to power / velocity.

### Drag
Force of drag can be calculated by the equation

Fd = 1/2 * CdA * density of the medium * v^2

Where v is the velocity of the rider relative to the air.
